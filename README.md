# Simple Python Shell

A lightweigt command-line shel built in Python that mimics basic Unix-like terminal behavior. This project demonstrates how to parse and execute user commands, handle built-in commands like cd and exit, and interface with system commands.

## Features
- Built-int support for cd and exit
- Executes system commands (e.g., ls, pwd, echo, etc.)
- Displays current working directory as prompt
- Handles errors gracefully (missing paths, invalid commands)
- Supports directory names woth spaces (e.g., cd "My Folder")

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL/PowerShell with limitations)
